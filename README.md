# Introducing the Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech (APLS) case study

The GitHub repository [`jackrechsteiner/introducing-APLS-case-study`](https://github.com/jackrechsteiner/introducing-APLS-case-study) hosts the files necessary for replicating the case study discussed in *Introducing the Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech (APLS), a publicly accessible, richly annotated corpus of sociolinguistic interviews* by Villarreal, Rechsteiner, Johnstone, & Kiesling (under review).

If you are interested in signing up for or signing into the APLS corpus, please visit [apls.pitt.edu](https://apls.pitt.edu/). 

If you are looking for the documentation pages for the APLS corpus, those can be found at [djvill.github.io/APLS](https://djvill.github.io/APLS/).

This README page describes the APLS case study, how the files relate to the APLS case study, and what files are in this repository.

## Description of case study

The case study presented here uses data from [APLS](https://apls.pitt.edu/) to analyze the diphthong /aʊ/ in closed syllables. 

The /aʊ/ diphthong makes for a good case study of Pittsburgh speech because pronouncing /aʊ/ like [aː] is emblematic of Pittsburghese (both in [academic work](https://doi.org/10.1215/00031283-77-2-148) and [mainstream media](https://www.wesa.fm/arts-sports-culture/2017-09-28/redd-up-your-pittsburghese-a-deep-dive-into-how-yinz-talk)). 

Additionally, a case study on a sociophonetic variable allows us to demonstrate how [APLS](https://apls.pitt.edu/) makes it possible to conduct complex analyses in relatively easy steps.

## Using this repo

The primary files of interest for those wishing to reproduce the case study results presented in *Introducing the Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech (APLS), a publicly accessible, richly annotated corpus of sociolinguistic interviews* are:

- `IntrotoAPLSCaseStudy.Rmd`
- `csvs/results_processwithpraat.csv`

With these two files, running the code in `IntrotoAPLSCaseStudy.Rmd` will produce the same results as the case study.

If you are interested in the steps required to produce the `results_processwithpraat.csv` file, please refer to the case study section in *Introducing the Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech (APLS), a publicly accessible, richly annotated corpus of sociolinguistic interviews*.
